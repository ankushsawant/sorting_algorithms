### Simple Sorting Algorithms in Python
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Selection Sort

All the sorting algorithms run in parallel, and are given the same set of 1000 random numbers. As soon as each algorithm completes execution, it reports the execution time in *seconds*.
